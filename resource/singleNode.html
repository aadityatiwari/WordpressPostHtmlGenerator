              <div class="tsl_descr">"Black" is a soliloquy by a broken-hearted man, who is remembering his absent lover. It became one of Pearl Jam's best known songs and is a central emotional piece on the album Ten. The track starts off melodic with a swirling narrative about a relationship evolving to the point of reaching a breaking point. As the lyrics become darker, so does the music, with the band subtly picking up the pace and providing a harsher attitude. The popularity of Black gained it everlasting rotation, putting it amongst Pearl Jam's most enduring songs.
